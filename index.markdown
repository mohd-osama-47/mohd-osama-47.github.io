I am a software engineer with experience in robotics and a passion for hardware tinkering and 3D printing. I am excited to share my skills and passions through my personal portfolio. My knowledge in software engineering, combined with my hobbies, allows me to have a unique perspective and approach when it comes to problem-solving. I am always looking for ways to improve my skills and take on new challenges. Check out my GitHub page to see some of my projects and feel free to contact me if you want to collaborate or discuss a new project.
