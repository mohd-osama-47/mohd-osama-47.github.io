As a software engineer with a background in robotics and a passion for hardware tinkering and 3D printing, I am excited to share my skills and experiences through my personal portfolio. My knowledge in software engineering, combined with my hobby in hardware, allows me to have a unique perspective and approach when it comes to problem-solving. I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills and take on new challenges. I am eager to learn more about new technologies and explore new opportunities in the field. Check out my GitHub page to see some of my projects and feel free to contact me if you want to collaborate or discuss a new project.
